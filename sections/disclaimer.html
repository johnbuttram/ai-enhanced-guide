      <p>This guide is here to help you get more out of your gaming PC — not to wreck it. Everything provided is based on real-world experience, tested advice, and commonly accepted best practices.</p>

      <p>That said, your system is unique. I can't physically stop a BIOS setting gone wrong, a misapplied undervolt, or a poorly optimized overclock. Please read carefully and take all actions at your own discretion.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>🔌 Back up your files before making system-level changes.</li>
        <li>🧠 Use common sense when applying tips — especially when they affect power, heat, or firmware.</li>
        <li>📘 When in doubt, don’t guess. You can always <strong>ask ChatGPT</strong> for clarification, <strong>search Google</strong>, or <strong>check with a computer-literate friend</strong> before proceeding.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="font-semibold text-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-200">You're in control. Own your decisions, and optimize with care.</p>
